Subsequently, I was able to completely rebuild an e-commerce website. The front end includes authentication, display of products in their categories, presentation of a retail item, addition to the shopping cart and integration of a payment module. For the back-end part, I was able to develop a module for generating invoices and a voucher system, allowing to change the status of orders made on the site (Sent / Paid / Shipped ..)"
